This repository is meant to host pre-compiled versions of The Macro Assembler AS by Alfred Arnold, so [MegaEnvironment](https://github.com/Franklin0770/megaenvironment) can download them without problems.  
The build won't get updated often, unless there's fixes for 68k and Z80 assembly or other related stuff.
